# Complexity

This implementation of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm has a complexity of O(|V||E|<sup>2</sup>). We were able to achieve this complexity by implementing a Graph Class containings a Vertex, V, for each die and letter. Then, we had to not only had to have forward edges, but reverse edges to connect each vertex, which resulted in E<sup>2</sup>. This Node, Edge, and Graph data structures were used to implement network flow by following Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
